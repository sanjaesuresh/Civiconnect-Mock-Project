# Extra Nextjs Information

# Environment Variables

To run this project, you'll need to get access to the environment variables.  We use [infisical](https://infisical.com) to securely store and share environment variables.

To get started using environment variables from infisical, follow the steps below:

1. Create an account on [civiconnect's infisical portal](https://infisical.civiconnect.net/) if you don't already have one.
2. Get access to the project, or create a new one if it hasn't already been created by someone else.  all of your environment variables should be stored in a subfolder in the project named `nextjs`
3. Install the infisical CLI: [https://infisical.com/docs/cli/overview](https://infisical.com/docs/cli/overview)
4. From the terminal, run `infisical login` and login with your infisical credentials.
5. If a `.infisical.json` file doesn't already exist in your project, run `infisical init` and select your project.
6. Finally, check that it's all been set up properly by starting your project with `npm run dev`.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
